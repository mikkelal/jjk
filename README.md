## 🚀 Features

The goal of this extension is to bring the great UX of Jujutsu into the VS Code UI. We are currently focused on achieving parity for commonly used features of VS Code's built-in Git extension, such as the various operations possible via the Source Control view.

Here's what you can do so far:

### 📁 File Management

- Track file statuses in the Working Copy
- Monitor file statuses across all parent changes
- View detailed file diffs for Working Copy and parent modifications  
  ![view file diff](images/diff.png)
- Add custom views for aggregate diffs, such as all changes from a branch's
  fork point to the working copy
- View line-by-line blame

### 💫 Change Management

- Create new changes with optional descriptions
- Edit descriptions for Working Copy and parent changes  
  ![edit description](images/describe.png)
- Move changes between Working Copy and parents  
  ![squash](images/squash.png)
- Move specific lines from the Working Copy to its parent changes
  ![squash range](images/squash_range.webp)
- Discard changes  
  ![restore](images/restore.png)
- Browse and navigate revision history

- Inspect the Source Control Graph with commit metadata, full commit
  messages, change stats, and quick hover actions for editing or
  creating a follow-up change
- Create merge changes

### 🔄 Operation Management

- Undo jj operations or restore to a previous state

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Ensure `jj` is installed and available in your system's `$PATH`, or configure a custom path using the `jjk.jjPath` setting

## Custom views

Custom views appear as additional groups in the Source Control panel.
Each view compares two jj revisions and updates along with the repository:

```json
{
  "jjk.customViews": [
    {
      "name": "Branch Changes",
      "from": "fork_point(main | @)",
      "to": "@"
    }
  ]
}
```

`to` is optional and defaults to `@`. Both values must resolve to a single jj
revision so the extension can open each file at both sides of the diff. When
`to` is `@`, the right-hand side is the editable working-copy file. Views that
target another revision remain read-only.
